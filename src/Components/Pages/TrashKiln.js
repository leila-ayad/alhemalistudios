          Leila is interested in versions of the present day that were conceived
          in the past. During COVID, she spent a lot of time thinking about the
          visions for the 2020's that were constructed in the 1960's. <br></br>

          The design for the raku kiln came from the book "Kiln Building with Space-Age
          Materials". It is constructed from an aluminum trash can lined with
          ceramic fiber. In raku, pieces are taken from the kiln at high
          temperatures and quickly transferred into a reduction chamber.
