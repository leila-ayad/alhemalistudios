        Leila is a studio potter and full-stack web developer based in Santa Fe,
        New Mexico. After graduating with a degree in Environment & Society B.S from Florida State University, she spent the first 3 years of her career exploring the
        American West as an Outdoor Educator. When COVID-19 demanded a shift,
        Leila began making ceramics and programming as a way to explore her
        internal space and the digital world.

        Intersecting worlds capture Leila's attention. As a mixed
        Libyan-American, she finds home in the places where concepts generally
        regarded as distinct overlap. Clay and Coding in practice both
        require interaction between Leila's artistic and scientific mind.
