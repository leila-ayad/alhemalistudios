            In a classic case of ecosystem disruption, the kelp from the Pacific Kelp Forests are struggling because of an explosion of sea urchins. The urchins are consuming the kelp at a disastrous rate, emboldened in the absence of their historical predators — otter and sea stars.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The overpopulated urchin turns a vibrant biodiverse community into a monoculture in a matter of years. However, conservation groups are finding remarkable success in restoring the kelp forests by simply removing the urchin from the water. This step is where the art practice begins – sea urchin shells and spines are made from calcium carbonate. In the ceramics world, we refer to this as whiting or dolomite. <b>This body of work uses urchin-derived calcium carbonate as a replacement for commercially mined whiting in the glazes. All of the glazes in the Urchinware line contain actual urchin that has been recovered by divers in an attempt to protect the kelp forests. </b>

            Urchinware is a cone 6 electric fired functional line designed and created by Leila in summer 2023 at Cobb Mountain Art and Ecology in California. The pieces either imitate sea urchins or have kelp on them to highlight the relationship between these organisms. This work is cute and inviting as it is intended to interest a large audience in order to explain a complex ecological problem.
